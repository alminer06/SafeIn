            	Tsunami Strikes Japan
            </h1>
            <h2>
            	On March 11, 2011, the world stood still as the people of Japan were pummeled by natural disaster -- an <br> 8.9 magnitude earthquake followed by a massive tsunami. Together they killed over 15,000 people and <br> triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant.
            </h2>
            <h3>
            	<br />
            	Like everyone else the past two weeks, I’ve been watching the news reports of the earthquake and ensuing tsunami in Japan with increasing horror and great sadness. Indelible images etched on my mind – of unimaginable suffering mixed with stories of hope; stories of human courage. And above all the inspiring humanity displayed by the Japanese victims.<br /><br />

A US camera crews finds a group of survivors huddled together making food – and immediately one of the men in the group offers the reporter some of their food. Food that they desperately need. His generosity made me cry. This man’s first thought was to look after his guests. How beautiful is that? Despite finding themselves losing everything, the Japanese have not lost their humanity, their courage and human decency. There are no riots, no looting, no ripping each other off. At least as far as we can tell. Every person is out there helping out other people. In shock, hungry, cold and grieving for lost loved ones, the Japanese are handling their own personal Armageddon calmly and in service.<br /><br />

It’s no dog eat dog and raping and pillaging we saw in New Orleans. What a difference in mentality and culture,  self-awareness and self-worth. If only the same could be said of the Japanese government; a government that has been more than economical with the truth about the impending nuclear fallout at Fukushima. A government that has allowed the building of 30, yes 30 US military bases on its territory. Where are the air drops, y’all?<br /><br />

No wonder the people who can escape are fleeing the country. Millions of people are living without running water or power in temperatures that fall below freezing at night. Half a million homes are without power in Tohoku and 2.5 million have no access to water. Food is critically short and bottled water is running low in many cities. Gasoline is scarce and homes are running out of kerosene to power heaters.<br /><br />

A 6.0 earthquake that centered near South Napa shook Bay Area residents in their beds early Sunday morning. U.S. Geological Survey officials said the earthquake is the largest to hit the Bay Area since the Loma Prieta Earthquake almost 25 years ago.<br /><br />

The temblor was recorded at 3:20 a.m. and was located about four miles northwest of American Canyon and six miles south-southwest of Napa, according to the Menlo Park-based USGS. It struck about seven miles below the earth's surface, USGS. officials said. The earthquake lies within a 44-mile wide set of major faults of the San Andreas Fault system that forms the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, according to the USGS. It was reportedly felt as far north as Ukiah to as far south as Salinas. The earthquake moved the earth several inches along the West Napa Fault, the most seismically active fault mapped between the Rogers Creek Fault to the west and the Concord-Gree Valley Fault to the east, according to the USGS.<br /><br />

The USGS. also reported 2.5 and 3.6 magnitude aftershocks about four miles southwest of Napa at 5:01 a.m. and 5:47 a.m., respectively. There were also more than 50 to 60 aftershocks reported throughout Sunday. As of the afternoon, the largest aftershock had a magnitude of 3.6, John Parrish, a geologist with the state Department of Conservation, said at a press conference.<br /><br />

Officials have said 30 to 70 small aftershocks could hit the area during the next week, but none will be as strong as the initial earthquake.<br /><br />

Napa city officials reported Monday morning that a total of 208 patients have been treated at Queen of the Valley Medical Center with 17 admitted. This is up from the 172 patients reported Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />
